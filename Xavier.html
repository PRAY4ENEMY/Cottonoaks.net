        <p>While data Analysis is the technology skill that I am most practiced in, I am always trying to build my skills by #learning to code. I try to keep my personal blog and library updated when something cool happens in my life or I add a new book so make sure to check it out.</p>
        <p>You can also, Check out my GITHUB page. I'm always finding cool ways to make my life easier 
            with libre and open source software. Hopefully you either find some of the scripts
            useful or tell me how poorly written they are.
        </p> 
        <p>Currently I have an automatic directory cleaner and insta cover letter 
            creator public so feel free use or add to the repositories.

        <p>In 2012, I bravely dawned a set of rental goalie pads and struggled onto the ice rink to replace our goalie who was too sick to compete. The following year, I decided to try the goalie thing for the whole season and quickly realised that I needed all the help I could get. 
	I would get my dad to take count of all the shots I took and where they came from and would look at his notes to find any weaknesses in my game.</p>
	<p>As I have grown in years, My skills and passion for data have also grown. I am proficient in both R and SQL and use these tools to gather
         large data sets and gather useful insights.</p>
