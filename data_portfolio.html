	<h3>Minimizing Tricks, Maximizing treats</h3>
</a>
<div>
    <leff>
      <p>With inflation being the scariest thing this spooky season, households are looking to maximize the popularity of 
      their house on Halloween while cutting cost where ever possible. In order to achieve these goals, we can control 
      internet survey results for price to find the candies that provide the most value for the price.</p> 
      <p>In order accurately control for price, we need to convert the percentile rank of the price of each candy into 
      a term that can equally adjust the head-to-head performance, as measured in win percentage, for a better comparison.</p>
      <p>We can derive an adjustment value that equally weights the win percentage by subtracting the price percentile 
      by the average percentile (~.50). This function give us each candies distance from the average price as expressed 
      by a number in-between -1 and +1.</p>

	<h3>applying lorenz curves to basketball</h3>
</a>
<div>
    <leff>
      <p>The Xavier Musketeers are putting on a good show in the tough Big East conference this year! Part of what makes this team special to watch is the depth of the roster. From leading score Souley Boum to 3pt sniper Adam Kunkel, it seems like any person on the roster is liable to go for 20. Coach Sean Miller has done a phenomenal job getting the ball to the players in situations where they have a strong advantage.</p> 
      <p>While classically the Lorenz curve and the gini index are used to measure income inequality, I thought that I would have some fun by applying these concepts to basketball.</p>

	<h3>The Impact of Winning on College Admission</h3>
</a>
<div>
    <leff> 
        <p><span class="bolded">Abstract</span>: The utility of success in college athletics is often debated by 
          those who have an interest the broader success of institutions of higher education.
           While some believe that any dollar spent on athletics is a dollar not going towards 
           investing in educational infrastructure, other hold that success in sports can be an 
           effective mechanism for raising the national profile of a university. After adjusting 
           winning based on a teams seeding in the NCAAâ€™s March Madness tournament and using a 
           fixed-effects regression model, we can estimate the causal impact of post-season success 
           in NCAA Division 1 basketball on the quantity of applications that a university receives. 
           We find that success, conditional on expectations, is causally correlated with a 1% increase 
           in the number of applications a schools admission office receives.</p>

	<h3>Implementing behavioral economics to improve recycling rates in the city of Cincinnati</h3>
</a>
<div>
    <leff> 
        <p><span class="bolded">Executive Summary</span>: While a lot of progress has been made in altering institutional processes, reinforcing recycling habits at the residential level has been challenging due to the messiness of human behaviour and psychology. We propose that behavioural nudges can be used to reinforce recycling habits and minimize residential recyclables that end up in the landfill. Both increasing the size of the recycling bin and prompting people to make a household recycling should improve residential diversion rates.</p>
