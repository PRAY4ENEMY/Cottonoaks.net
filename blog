            <p>
               I have a simple goal at the moment. I am trying to make a pdf generator that takes some user input from a 
               GUI interface and formats a cover letter instantly. While I made a working prototype in Python, the program not universal and 
               didn't have the speed that I wanted.

               So now I am in the process of learning Rust and completing my project with the language. What is really cool about writing this code in 
               Rust is that the Rust compiler is such a wonderful teacher. It always outputs really helpful hints when the compiler spits a error 
               or a warning. This has made the debugging process so much less frustrating compared to the previous language I learned in R.  
            </p>

               Also, I visited my dad in PA this week along with my brother. While he was unhelpful with actually getting my code to compile. He did 
               give me good book recommendations and answered some high level questions I had about programming.

	    <h2>2. Vim has been configured! (2023-02-25)</h2>
            <p>
               Learning to use Vim has been a wonderful journey for me.
               A lot like riding a bike, there comes a point where you feel like you just get it. 
               A bit ago, I finally felt like I cracked the code to this editor and finally decided to make it a full time home for all my coding needs. 
            </p>
            <p>
               With the help of "The Primeagean" on Youtube, I configured neovim to be a comfy editor that has LSP autocomplete, wonderful syntax highlighting and wonderful theme that allows me to see the waifu de jour in the transparency background. 
            </p>

               I am by no means a professional at using this software but I am slowly gaining more and more confidence when using vim. To those who are looking to learn vim for yourselves. I recommend simple throwing yourself into the fire. Just put on vim motions in your IDE or download vim and just use it until you start to feel confortable. Going into insert mode and just using the mouse when you get stuck is the approach that I took.
